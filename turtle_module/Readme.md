# Turtle Module

Turtle is a pre-installed library in Python that is similar to the virtual canvas that we can draw pictures and attractive shapes. It provides the onscreen pen that we can use for drawing
The turtle Library is primarily designed to introduce children to the world of programming. With the help of Turtle's library, new programmers can get an idea of how we can do programming with Python in a fun and interactive way.

It is beneficial to the children and for the experienced programmer because it allows designing unique shapes, attractive pictures, and various games. We can also design the mini games and animation. In the upcoming section, we will learn to various functionality of turtle library.

### Getting started with turtle
Before working with the turtle library, we must ensure the two most essential things to do programming.

### Python Environment
- We must be familiar with the working Python environment. We can use applications such as IDLE or Jupiter Notebook. We can also use the Python interactive shell.
### Python Version 
- We must have Python 3 in our system; if not, then download it from Python's official website.

The turtle is built in library so we don't need to install separately. We just need to import the library into our Python environment.

The Python turtle library consists of all important methods and functions that we will need to create our designs and images. Import the turtle library using the following command.

    import turtle  
Now, we can access all methods and functions
